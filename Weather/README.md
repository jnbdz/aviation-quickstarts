#### Exemple
- KTUL 250153Z 04011KT 10SM SCT250 08/01 RMK AO2 SPL143 T00780006
  - KTUL - Airport identifier
  - 250153Z - Date and Time in Zulu - 
    - 25 - Day of the month
    - 01 - Hour
    - 53 - Minute
    - Z - To get the local time you will need to add  hours based on **daylight saving time** (timezone).
      - [Z-time (Coordinated Universal Time) | NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/time)
      - So for Eastern time (+5) you need to substract 5 (-5) to the ZULU time that you get (use the table as ref. found in the noaa website)
      - [...]
  - 04011KT
    - Wind direction - 40Â°
    - Wind speed - 11 KT
    - 11G21KT (so with a G) - The wind varies from 11 and 21 KT
