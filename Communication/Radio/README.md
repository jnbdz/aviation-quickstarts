# Radio | Communication
Radio is indispensable in the world of aviation.

But it is not infallible.

## Wavelength and Frequency
Radio transmitter sets up waves in the air. The length of these waves remains constant, but the stregth, or amplitude, decreases with distance.

### Definitions: 
- **wavelength**: linear measurement of the wave (reffered in meters)
- **cycle**: the period in which the wave vibrates (that is, rises and falls) between its crest and trough
- **frequency**: number of cycles per second of time
- **kilohertz (KHz)**: 
- **megahertz (MHz)**:
