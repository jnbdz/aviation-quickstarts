## Emergency Checklist

## Passenger Briefing Details
1. *Indicate where are the exits (doors)*
2. When exiting the airplance (C172) do it via the back to avoid propeller
3. No smoking is allowed onboard the aircraft at all times
4. *Explain how to use the seatbelt* (e.g.: how to adjust, bockle or un-bockle, etc)
5. Keep the seatbelt on at all times whilst we are flying or taxiing
6. *Explain how to use the seatbelts in case of an forced landing* (you need to cross your arms and based on where you are sitting you grab with one hand the seatbelt that overlapping belt. So on the left seat you use the right hand and on the left the opposite)
7. *Show where the passangers can find the first aid kit*
8. *Show where the fire extinguisher is* (between the two front seats)
9. Explain where and what the ELT is (mention 121.5 and 7600 and 7700)
