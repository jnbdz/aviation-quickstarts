# Engines | 172 | Cessna | Aviation | Quickstarts
Cessna 172 generally use [Lycoming O-320 Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoming_O-320) engines.

## Notes
### Ground
> Use of the carburetor air heat on the ground should be held to a minimum.
> On some installations the air does not pass through the air filter, and dirt and foreign substances
> can be taken into the engine with the resultant cylinder and piston ring wear. In dirt and dust free
> areas carburetor air heat should be used on the ground to make certain it is functioning properly, or
> when carburetor icing conditions require it.
