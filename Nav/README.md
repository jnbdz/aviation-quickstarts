## CX-3
### Rhumb Line
> A **rhumb line** (**loxodrome**) is a path on the Earth's surface that crosses all meridians at the same angle, maintaining a constant compass bearing. It represents a straight line on a Mercator projection map and is used in navigation for its simplicity in following a steady course.

#### Introduction
The Rhumb Line function on the CX-3 Flight Computer allows you to calculate the distance and true course between two geographic points (waypoints) along a path of constant compass bearing. This is useful for navigation when you want to maintain a steady heading without adjusting for the Earth's curvature over short distances.

#### What Is a Rhumb Line?
A **rhumb line** is a path on the Earth's surface that crosses all meridians at the same angle, maintaining a constant compass direction. On a Mercator projection map, a rhumb line appears as a straight line, simplifying navigation by allowing you to follow a consistent heading.

#### How to Use the Rhumb Line Function
1. Go to `FLT`
2. Select the Rhumb Line Function
3. Input Waypoint A (Starting Point)
  - **Enter Latitude**
    - Under `POINT: A`, select `LAT`.
    - Input the latitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (**DMS**) or decimal degrees (there are two types of input **°** or **DMS**... Choose **DMS**).
      - **Degrees:** Enter the degrees portion of the latitude.
      - **Minutes:** Enter the minutes.
      - **Seconds:** Enter the seconds (if applicable).
  - **Enter Longitude**
    - Select `LONG`.
    - Input the longitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) or decimal degrees.
      - **Degrees:** Enter the degrees portion of the longitude.
      - **Minutes:** Enter the minutes.
      - **Seconds:** Enter the seconds (if applicable).
4. Input Waypoint B (Destination Point)
  - Repeat the same process
5. You should have your answer:
```
RHUMB LINE: AB
TCrs   ______ Degrees
DIST  _______ NM (make sure to have the right unit conv)
```

An example would be a question like **What is the distance between these latitudes: N37°25’ and N39°10’?** == 120.83SM (make sure you have the right **unit conv**)
