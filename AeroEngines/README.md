The data points: 

```python
[19.634  1.688 -0.044  0.    -0.    -0.   ]
[ 1.5896e+01  1.9160e+00 -1.4600e-01  1.1000e-02 -0.0000e+00  0.0000e+00]
[ 8.797e+00  2.878e+00 -3.080e-01  2.400e-02 -1.000e-03  0.000e+00]
[ 4.955e+00  3.183e+00 -5.500e-01  6.500e-02 -4.000e-03  0.000e+00]
```

Code used: 

```python
for a in [c1,c2,c3,c4]:

    # Unpack input array
    dp, t = a[:,0], a[:,1]

    # Coeffs - Low to high power
    c = npp.polyfit(dp, t, deg=5)
    print(np.round(c, 3))

    # Curve samples
    dp_s = np.linspace(dp[0], dp[-1], 20)
    t_s = npp.polyval(dp_s, c)
    
    # Plot everything
    ax.plot(t_s, dp_s, c='m', lw=3) # samples
    ax.scatter(t, dp, c='m', s=90) # input points
```


```python
c1 = np.array([[-13.9, -13.7],
               [-9.2,  -0.],
               ...
```

Since the original functions are not injective (folded curves), the polynomials are the inverse functions, they take the dew point as the variable, and return the temperature: 
```math
t=p(dp)
```
