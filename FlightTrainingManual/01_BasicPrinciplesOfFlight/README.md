How can a heavier-than-air happen?
## The Third Law of Motion
- "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"
- *thrust* - pulls the iarcraft ahead
  - Because the propeller pushes a mass of air backward
- *lift* - wing meeting the oncoming air
  - Under the wing: Decresed velocity airflow
  - Top of the wing: Increased velocity airflow
## The Atmosphere
### Density and Pressure
- The higher you are the less air *density* you have
- *air pressure* - Changes in density are measured
- Avg. pressure at sea level: 14.7 pounds per square inch
- 29.92 inches
- Standard situation:
  - Pressure drops from 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level to 10.2 pounds per square inch at 10,000 feet
### Temperature Changes (Lapse Rate)
- Increase in height == decrease in air temperature

## The Four Forces
1. *lift*
  - What pulls up the plane
2. *weight* 
  - What pulls down the plane (opposite affect of *lift*)
  - Total weight of the aircraft and its content
3. *thrust* 
  - What pulls foward the plane
  - Provided by the propeller
4. *drag*
  - What slows down the plane (pulls back; opposite affect of *thrust*)
  - Resistance of the air when in contact with the plane and all its components
  - Thrust and drag are the forces that act on the aircraft in a level flight
